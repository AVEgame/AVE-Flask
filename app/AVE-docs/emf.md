At [Elecromagetic Field (EMF) 2016](https://emfcamp.org), all attendees were given
a [TiLDA Mk&pi;](https://badge.emfcamp.org/wiki/TiLDA_MK3) badge. We
made a version of AVE 1.? that runs on this badge.

You can download the most recent stable version of AVE 
from the app library on your badge, or from [here](http://api.badge.emfcamp.org/app/mscroggs/ave)'.
