<h2>About AVE</h2>

{% include 'ave.html' %} began life as a <a href='/docs/python.md'>Python game</a>. At <a href='https://emfcamp.org' target='new'>Electromagnetic Field 2016 (EMF)</a>
we made a version of {% include 'ave.html' %} that runs on the <a href='/docs/badge.md'>TiLDA Mk&pi; badge</a>
that was given to every attendee. Shortly after EMF, we began work on a javascript version of {% include 'ave.html' %}, this website and 
Android and iOS apps (coming soon).
